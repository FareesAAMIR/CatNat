Introduction to QGIS

QGIS and ArcGIS are the two most widely used Geographic Information System (GIS) platforms.
They differ significantly in philosophy, cost, ecosystem, and typical use cases.

Since QGIS is free and open-source, it is the software we will use.

QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) is a free, open-source GIS application that allows users to create, edit, analyze, and visualize geographic (spatial) data.

How to Use QGIS


1. Types of Spatial Data

QGIS works with two main types of geographic data:

  - Raster Data

    Pixel-based data

    Examples:

    Satellite images

    Aerial photographs

    Elevation models

    Each pixel contains a value (color, elevation, temperature, etc.)

  - Vector Data

    Geometry-based data

    Represented by:

      Points (e.g. locations, landmarks)

      Lines (e.g. roads, rivers)

      Polygons (e.g. buildings, administrative boundaries)

2. Data Sources

  - Spatial data can be obtained from open data platforms, such as:

  - opendata.apur.org (urban and territorial data)

3. Ways to Import Data into QGIS

  - There are two main ways to load data into QGIS:



1. Downloading Data

Download files directly (Shapefile, GeoJSON, GeoTIFF, etc.)

Import them into QGIS from your local computer

2. Using Web Services (Live Data Streams)

Data can be accessed without downloading files

Common GIS web services:

  - WMS / WMTS (map images)

  - WFS (vector features)

  - WCS (raster coverage)

4. Geospatial Web Services

  - The French national mapping agency provides geospatial services via:

  - geoservices.ign.fr

These services allow direct access to official geographic data using:

  - WMS

  - WMTS

  - WFS

  - WCS
