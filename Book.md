Books on Nat Cat and Related Topics

This file will serve as a record of all the books I read on natural catastrophes, climate risks, and related subjects. I’ll include summaries, key takeaways, and reflections from each book. The goal is to build a solid understanding of the field and keep track of my learning journey.

1/ Introduction to Catastrophe Risk Modelling: A Physics-based Approach

Author: Arnaud Mignan
Description

This textbook focuses on the physics of catastrophe processes and is aimed at advanced students. It covers dozens of natural and man-made perils and the latest developments in catastrophe modelling. Combining statistics, applied physics, environmental sciences, civil engineering, and psychology, it introduces fundamental concepts to understand catastrophe phenomenology and risk quantification.

Topics include:

Geophysical, hydrological, meteorological, climatological, biological, extraterrestrial, technological, and socio-economic hazards

Domino effects and events influenced by global warming

Tools to develop a CAT model from hazard to loss assessment

Features:

Online CAT risk model starter-kit and Python Jupyter sandbox tutorial

Equations, pseudocode, and illustrations for reproducible practice

Focus on practical application to solidify learning
